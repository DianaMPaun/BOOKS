# Books ðŸ“š

Welcome to my **Books** folder! I'm a passionate reader with a deep love for books. Iâ€™ve created several small projects that combine my passion for reading with my skills in **data analytics** and **programming**.

These projects focus on exploring data related to books and creating interactive and analytical experiences. Each project is designed to help me practice and enhance my skills in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, **data visualization**, and **programming**.

Explore the various projects Iâ€™ve created and how they bring together my love for reading with the exciting world of data!
